%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{I am an eneregetic, curious and creative developer. My love for code is driven by my love for math, algorithms and logical puzzles. I love exploring new ideas, and is always willing to learn.
I like people about as much as I like logic, and therefore I work best in a small team. It is easy for me to be self-motivated when I am surrounded by peers, but I tend toget distracted when I am alone.
I flourish in work environments whith many freedoms, whether those are creative or environmental. A structured environment may seem tedious or even overwhelming to me.} % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

\section{Experience}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
    \twentyitem{2018-Present}{Software Developer (Mostly Computational Geometry)}{Itecho}
    {I did most of the mathematical work for a client in manufacturing. I also worked on the rest of the stack. We use .NET Core with C\# for the backend, vue.js for the frontend and PostgreSQL as a database.}
    \twentyitem{2017-2018}{Life Coach}{Self Employed}
    {I had my own coaching practice. My work was non-technical, but I did learn a lot about people, leadership, motivation and public speaking.}
    \twentyitem{2016-2017}{DevOps Engineer}{Airvantage}
    {This is the same job as at VAS-X (our product was bought by Airvantage, along with the team). However, I moved back into development a bit, and I had a nice variety of responsibilities. From keeping the systems operational, to being involved in developing patches and new features.}
    \twentyitem{2014-2016}{Support Engineer}{VAS-X}
    {I was part of the team running an Airtime Advance System at multiple telecom companies. My duties included mostly operational work, with a few support tickets and regular interaction with corporate clients. I did most of my technical work directly in the Oracle database, because 90\% of the project consisted of stored procedures.}
    \twentyitem{2014}{Software Developer}{iPLan Industrial Engineers}
    {At iPlan we wrote extensions for Syspro(an ERP System) using C\#.NET}
    \twentyitem{2012-2013}{Software Engineer}{Libralex}
    {At Libralex I had a wide range of responsibilties. I worked on software for veterinary clinics, for which I was the technical person on the project. That meant that I did support at all levels and the development work. The project was written in VB.NET}
    \twentyitem{2010-2011}{Tutor}{Stellenbosch University}
    {While studying I kept myself busy, and earned a small income tutoring younger students.}
    \twentyitem{2008}{Camp Facilitator}{Wortelgat Outreach Trust}
    {This is what I did in my GAP year. I worked a lot with children and teenagers, teaching various soft skills through camp activities.}

I am first and foremost a Christian. I take a heavy interest in theology, and in what it means to be a Christian.
My family is also very important to me, and I will go to great lengths to ensure that I spend enough time with my wife and my son.
I like the outdoors, so I often spend time walking my dog, mountian biking, or just enjoying nature with my family.

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
