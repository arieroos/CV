\section{Experience}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
    \twentyitem{2024-Now}{Freelance Software Developer}{127development.com}
    {I work on a variety of projects, from large web applications to simple script automations, and I am always looking for new challenges. Some highlights include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developing a full file syncing application for Windows Desktop to make it easier for civil engineers to keep their files in sync in a way that integrates well with their custom processes and systems.
        \item Improving performance, security, and maintainability for the server of a complex web application.
        \item Improving the performance of a complex harvest forecasting model by 99\%, by improving the model's usage of the numpy library.
    \end{itemize}
    I gained experience in client relations, C\#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Javascript, MySQL, SQLite, and Linux Server Admin.}
    \twentyitem{2020-2024}{Senior Software Developer}{Direct Debit}
        {I worked as lead developer on Direct Debit, a debit order system, and a solutions architect for PCI Vault, a PCI compliant credit card storage system.
        Some accomplishments include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Improving the usability and speed of the system by rewriting some SQL queries to massively improve performance.
            \item Reducing operating costs by quite a big margin. I did this by implementing a new payment processing back-end, which allowed for cheaper transaction processing.
            \item Scaling PCI Vault to handle thousands transaction per second by rewriting the system to use a distributed database and serverless architecture. This also reduced operating costs to only a few dollars per month.
            \item Improving the usability and client retention of PCI Vault by implementing a custom documentation system, which allowed clients to use, test, and understand the APIs directly from their browser.
        \end{itemize}
        I gained experience in Golang, Python, Javascript, Svelte, PostgreSQL, Linux Server Admin, and AWS (Lambda and DynamoDB).}
    \twentyitem{2018-2020}{Software Developer}{Itecho}
    {We developed a product for automating the business and engineering processes of a ducting factory.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I developed the parameterised models on the project, which included a lot of Mathematics and consulting with the client's mechanical engineers.
        \item I built a very nice library for computational geometry.
        \item On the frontend I built and displayed a few 3D models, and built user interfaces to record parameters for the models I developed.
        \item I wrote a genetic algorithm to improve nesting, we managed to reduce the client's offcuts by up to 25\%.
        \item I helped to develop the MVC flow for the model parameters.
    \end{itemize}
    I gained experience in client relations, C\#, .NET Core, EF Core, Javascript, vue.js, and PostgreSQL.}

    \twentyitem{2016-2017}{DevOps Engineer}{Airvantage}
    {I moved to Airvantage when they bought my product and team from VAS-X. I picked up some development responsibilities after the move.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I worked with the developers to get bugs fixed. I developed some of the patches myself. I investigated the other bugs, and communicated my findings to the developers, so that they could focus on the fix.
        \item I was responsible for reconciling our data with our biggest client's data.
        \item Analysing data to find meaningful information.
        \item Generating meaningful reports using SQL.

        \item I did a lot of second line support tickets.
