%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{I am an eneregetic, curious and creative developer. My love for code is driven by my love for math, algorithms and logical puzzles. I love exploring new ideas, and am always willing to learn.
I like people about as much as I like logic, and therefore I work best in a small team. It is easy for me to be self-motivated when I am surrounded by peers, but I tend toget distracted when I am alone.
I flourish in work environments where I can be creative and innovative. I prefer to work in an unstrucutred environment, because it is better suited to innovation.} % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
    \twentyitem{2018-Now}{Software Developer}{Itecho}
    {We developed a product, called Aircost, for automating the business and engineering processes of a ducting factory.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I developed the parameterised models on the project, which included a lot of Mathematics and consulting with the client's mechanical engineers.
        \item I built a very nice library for computational geometry.
        \item On the frontend I built and displayed a few 3D models, and built user interfaces to record parameters for the models I developed.
        \item I wrote a genetic algorithm to improve nesting, we managed to reduce the client's offcuts by up to 25\%.
        \item I helped to develop the MVC flow for the model parameters.
    \end{itemize}
    I gained experience in client relations, C\#, .NET Core, EF Core, Javascript, vue.js, and PostgreSQL.}
    \twentyitem{2017-2018}{Life Coach}{Self Employed}
    {I had my own life coaching practice. I worked with clients on a one to one basis to help improve their lives, and I also presented a few self-improvement workshops. I helped people to quit smoking, get their lives back on track after traumatising events, improve their social lives, etc. My work was non-technical, but I did learn a lot about people, leadership, motivation and public speaking.}
    \twentyitem{2016-2017}{DevOps Engineer}{Airvantage}
    {I moved to Airvantage when they bought my product and team from VAS-X. I picked up some development responsibilities after the move.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I worked with the developers to get bugs fixed. I developed some of the patches myself. I investigated the other bugs, and communicated my findings to the developers, so that they could focus on the fix.
        \item I was responsible for reconciling our data with our biggest client's data.
        \item Analysing data to find meaningful information.
        \item Generating meaningful reports using SQL.
        \item I was on call every third week, in which I had to respond to after-hours issues within SLA times. And deploy patches at night when the systems were quiet.
        \item I interfaced with corporate clients often, making sure to complete the necessary documentation for every issue or patch.
        \item I did a lot of second line support tickets.
    \end{itemize}
    I worked for an excellent CTO, who encouraged us to automate our work. I gained a lot of experience in SQL (in Oracle).}
    \twentyitem{2014-2016}{Support Engineer}{VAS-X}
    {I was part of the team running an Airtime Advance System at multiple telecom companies. My duties included mostly operational work, 2nd-line support tickets, generating reports from SQL, and regular interaction with corporate clients. I picked up a lof of SQL (in Oracle) and experience and wrote some awesome SQL queries.}
